step1:-
Retrieve the Wi-Fi Profile Metadata: The code begins by executing the Windows command netsh wlan display profiles via the subprocess module. This command obtains metadata about the system's available Wi-Fi profiles.
meta_data = subprocess.check_output(['netsh', 'wlan', 'show', 'profiles'])

step2:-
Decode and Split Data: Because the command's output is binary, it must first be decoded into a string. Then it is divided into lines for further processing.
data = meta_data.decode('utf-8', errors="backslashreplace")
data = data.split('\n')

step3:-
Extract Profile Names: The code iterates through each line of the data. When it finds a line containing "All User Profile", it extracts the name of the Wi-Fi profile.
for line in data:
    if "All User Profile" in line:
        profile_name = line.split(":")[1].strip()
        profiles.append(profile_name)
step4:-
Print Wi-Fi Names and Passwords Header: Before printing the Wi-Fi names and passwords, a header is printed for clarity.
print("{:<30}| {:<}".format("Wi-Fi Name", "Password"))
print("----------------------------------------------")

step:-5
Retrieve and Print Wi-Fi Passwords: For each Wi-Fi profile, the code tries to retrieve its password using the netsh wlan show profile command. If successful, it extracts the password and prints it along with the profile name. If an error occurs during password retrieval, it prints an error message.
for profile in profiles:
    try:
        results = subprocess.check_output(['netsh', 'wlan', 'show', 'profile', profile, 'key=clear'])
        results = results.decode('utf-8', errors="backslashreplace")
        results = results.split('\n')
        password = [line.split(":")[1].strip() for line in results if "Key Content" in line]
        print("{:<30}| {:<}".format(profile, password[0] if password else ""))
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
        print("Error occurred while retrieving password for", profile)

step6:-
Proper Exception Handling: The code handles possible faults correctly by capturing any exceptions that may arise during subprocess calls. If an error occurs, it displays the relevant error message.

Overall, these improvements guarantee that the code receives Wi-Fi profile information correctly and handles failures graciously.
